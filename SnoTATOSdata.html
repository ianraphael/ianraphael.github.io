<h1>SnoTATOS live data</h1>

<p>We deployed four SnoTATOS networks in the Lincoln Sea in late April 2024 as part
  of the <a href="https://espo.nasa.gov/arcsix/content/ARCSIX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA ARCSIX project</a>.
  Below you'll find live data from the active networks.
<br>
<p>Data are collected with a four-hour sampling interval. We forward-fill each station's time series to remove gaps, then low-pass-filter the
  data using an exponential moving average filter. The ultrasonic rangefinders that we use are sensitive to icing and wind-blown snow; for
  this reason, readings are typically noisy during the winter.
